# julklappsspel
Digital version of a christmas gift game (julklappsspel).

In normal years, my family would gather - often at my grandma's house- for christmas and amongst other things play a game with some small presents.
We place our presents on a table, sit around and start rolling the dice. If I remember right, there is one die and if you roll a six you get to take a present and move it to your side of the table. After you roll, it is the next person's turn. Several people might want the same package so, resulting in a tug of luck. The game is timed. It is a silly thing with a bit of panic but also very fun.

Now, in this year of 2020 with a pandemic and health concerns, I want to create an alternative christmas that is safe but similar.

We cannot get together in person, but we can get together online. The game should be multiplayer and easy for everyone to join in, therefore a webpage is probably required. When the players log in I want them to be able to create a little profile, so that we can recognize each other.

Oh, right. My uncle is color-blind so color-coding should be kept to a minimum. Also, keeping track of where the presents are is an element of the actual game so that is another argument to avoid artificial color-coding.

I imagine a table in the background, seen from above, with photographs of presents on top. Each present has a codeword beside it. There is a die icon somewhere on the screen. The player whose turn it is can click on this die to roll. If the player is lucky, they get to pick a present. It'd be fun if the die-icon moved about randomly each turn. I think the presents should be taken with a simple click and drag to your zone, like in the actual game.

Another aspect of the game is the hectic nature, which I might be able to simulate with emotes. Maybe you can ping the table. Finally, a clock should preferably be showing the time. This could however easily be done externally.

I imagine that an admin creates a session with a key and then the other players can log in. The admin creates a game, setting the time.

Requirements:
- multiplayer
- turn order
- gift icons
- die icon

Bonus:
- moving gift and die icons.
- players arranged in turn order.
- timer
- output game results as text (who got what gift) so that we can post and give the gifts.
